# Pseudo Frogger Proposal

## What is Frogger?

Frogger is a one player retro game where a frog must cross multiple lanes and a lake to get to the other side. I had previously attempted to create this game when I knew almost nothing about javascript. Now I would like to start from scratch and create a game that can collect a score with collision detection and other jquery functionalities.

### Timeline

| Date        | Event                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10/6        | **Phase 1: Project Approvals**<br/> Research frogger games, create a mockup, write the proposal, look for jquery guides.                                                                                              |
| 10/6-10/9 | **Phase 2: Design & Functionality**<br/> Create a design and sketch out everything. Code it, and have it 70% complete. |
| 10/10-10/11 | **Phase 3: Functionality**<br/> 
- Collision detection solved
- Ability to add lives when frogger lands on fly
- Ability to store name and score into high score page 
- Ability to remove scores in high scores page based on length
- Ability to end game if timer runs out
- Ability to add points if frogger accompanies other frog to other side|                                                                                                                                                |
| 10/12 | **Phase 3:**<br/> 
- Add prototypes
- Optimize
- Push it!                                                                                                                                     |

### Necessary Deliverables

- A **working game, built by you**, hosted on the internet
- A **git repository hosted on Github.com**, with a link to your hosted game in the URL section, and **frequent** commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
- **A ``readme.md`` file** which must include:
  - Explanations of the technologies used
    - I used jquery, html, and css.
  - Approach taken
    - My approach was to create a basic design and then try to get collision detection working before doing anything else.
  - User stories
  - Wireframes
  - How-to-use instructions
    - Instructions on how to play game? click Play on the first page then click play again, the game will begin. Use the arrow keys to navigate frog. Get to the other side. You keep collecting score.
  - Unsolved problems
    - The frog is not able to hop on objects above the water and travel with them. The frog doesn't die if it hits the water. There is no scores page. No disclaimer. The frog doesn't win by landing on a lilypad. The score is also not adding up correctly amung other things.
- An [**issue ticket** created on **this repository**](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-delorean/PROJECT_01-Game/issues/new) that has a link to your GitHub repository and your deployed game. (Also include struggles, wins, comfort, completion, etc.)
