# Pseudo Frogger Proposal

## What is Frogger?

Frogger is a one player retro game where a frog must cross multiple lanes and a lake to get to the other side. I had previously attempted to create this game when I knew almost nothing about javascript. Now I would like to start from scratch and create a game that can collect a score with collision detection and other jquery functionalities.
