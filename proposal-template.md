# Pseudo Frogger Proposal

## What is Frogger?

Frogger is a one player retro game where a frog must cross multiple lanes and a lake to get to the other side. I had previously attempted to create this game when I knew almost nothing about javascript. Now I would like to start from scratch and create a game that can collect a score with collision detection and other jquery functionalities.

|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10/6        | **Phase 1: Project Approvals**<br/> Research frogger games, create a mockup, write the proposal, look for jquery guides.                                                                                              |
| 10/6-10/9 | **Phase 2: Design & Functionality**<br/> Create a design and sketch out everything. Code it, and have it 70% complete. |
| 10/10-10/11 | **Phase 3: Functionality**<br/> 
- Collision detection solved
- Ability to add lives when frogger lands on fly
- Ability to store name and score into high score page 
- Ability to remove scores in high scores page based on length
- Ability to end game if timer runs out
- Ability to add points if frogger accompanies other frog to other side|                                                                                                                                                |
| 10/12 | **Phase 3:**<br/> 
- Add prototypes
- Optimize
- Push it!                                                                                                                                     |
